Please give us as much detail about the feature request as you can. 
This would be stuff like: Command names, prefixes, aliases, A detailed description, potential arguments, justification for why/use case that is worth having in a bot, and anything else you'd like to include. 
Please remember, more is usually better but we aren't looking for an essay. Just get your point to us in the best way possible be it a crudely drawn painting, or a novel.
