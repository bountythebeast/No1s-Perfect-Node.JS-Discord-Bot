Description: <br>
Hello,<br>
This was created originally as a c# bot for our small little community to help show the status of our servers, Who's online, and a few other things. Since its original implementation, its grown to quite the project. After about a years work on the bot, I finally hit the limitations of what was possible in C#. Since then, i've been working on rewriting the bot in Node.JS! To be completely frank, I have barely touched Node before beginning this endeavor. This means <br> MY CODE WILL BE BAD <br>
But that's okay. If you have any suggestions, find any bugs, or have some improvements please feel free. This is now open sources because i'm only one person. That being said, please take it easy.

Best regards, <br>
